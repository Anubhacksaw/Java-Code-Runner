# Java-Code-Runner
Here is a small shell code to codding in java
I wrote this code for vim text editor 
# if u want to change the editor use this command:- 
sed -i 's/vim/new-editor-name/g' javarunner.sh 
to use this file java must be pre installed. 
# before run the file use this command:- 
chmod 777 javarunner.sh
